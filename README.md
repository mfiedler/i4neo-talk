# i4neo Talk Boilerplate

This is a very basic example for a presentation using the
[i4neo Theme](https://gitlab.cs.fau.de/i4/tex/i4neo.git)
-- and perhaps a good starting point for your next presentation!


## Usage

Make sure to checkout the submodule as well, for example by using

    git clone --recursive https://gitlab.cs.fau.de/i4/tex/i4neo-talk.git

Build this using

    make

or using live preview

    make preview-talk
